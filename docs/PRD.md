## 1. Title & Authors  
**subosity-installer** — A turnkey, self-hosted deployment tool for the Subosity app  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 23, 2025  
**Authors:** Product Manager, Lead Developer, Security Engineer  

---

## 2. Executive Summary  
The `subosity-installer` provides a production-ready, security-first deployment solution for the open-source Subosity application. It abstracts the complexity of self-hosting Supabase and containerized React frontends into a single, idempotent command that can be executed via direct script download or Docker container.

---

## 3. Purpose & Scope  

**Primary Purpose:**  
Eliminate the complexity barrier for self-hosting Subosity by providing a turnkey installer that handles Docker installation, Supabase CLI orchestration, database migrations, frontend containerization, and systemd service management with enterprise-grade reliability and security.

**Core Scope:**  
- **Zero-dependency installation**: Works on fresh Linux systems with only `curl`/`wget`
- **Docker ecosystem management**: Automated Docker & Docker Compose installation and configuration
- **Supabase orchestration**: Complete Supabase self-hosted setup including database, auth, storage, and edge functions
- **Application deployment**: Vite React frontend containerization and deployment
- **Service management**: Systemd unit creation and lifecycle management
- **Data safety**: Automated backups, rollbacks, and migration safety checks
- **Multi-environment support**: Production, staging, and development configurations
- **Security hardening**: TLS termination, secure defaults, and audit logging

**Out of Scope:**  
- Custom DNS management (users must configure their own domain/subdomain)
- Email/SMS provider configuration (users configure their own SMTP/Twilio)
- Advanced clustering or high-availability setups
- Windows or macOS support (Linux-only)

---

## 4. Detailed Use Cases

### 4.1 Fresh Installation via Direct Script Download

**Primary Command:**
```bash
# Download and install latest release binary
curl -fsSL https://github.com/subosity/subosity-installer/releases/latest/download/subosity-installer-linux-amd64 -o subosity-installer
chmod +x subosity-installer
./subosity-installer setup --env prod --domain mysubosity.com --email admin@example.com

# Or install via package manager (future)
# apt install subosity-installer
# yum install subosity-installer
```

**Alternative via Docker Container:**
```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v /opt/subosity:/app \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  subosity/installer:latest setup \
    --env prod \
    --domain mysubosity.com \
    --email admin@example.com
```

**Detailed Installation Flow:**
1. **Thin Binary Execution**
   - Parse command-line arguments and validate basic syntax
   - Detect host operating system and architecture
   - Validate minimum system requirements (basic checks only)
   - Check if Docker is installed and accessible

2. **Docker Environment Preparation**
   - Install Docker CE and Docker Compose v2 if missing
   - Configure Docker daemon with security best practices
   - Add user to docker group with proper permissions
   - Validate Docker daemon is running and accessible

3. **Container Image Management**
   - Pull latest `subosity/installer:latest` container image
   - Verify image integrity and signatures
   - Prepare volume mounts and environment variables

4. **Container Delegation**
   - Execute container with full installation arguments
   - Mount necessary host directories (`/opt/subosity`, `/var/run/docker.sock`, etc.)
   - Forward all user arguments to container process

5. **Container-Based Installation** (All logic inside container)
   - Complete system validation and requirements checking
   - Supabase CLI installation and verification
   - Database initialization and schema migrations
   - React frontend building and optimization
   - SSL/TLS certificate generation and configuration
   - System service creation and management
   - Backup system initialization and scheduling
   - Health monitoring setup and validation

6. **Installation Verification**
   - Container validates all services are running correctly
   - Performs end-to-end health checks
   - Reports installation status back to thin binary
   - Thin binary reports final status to user

4. **Directory Structure Creation**
   ```
   /opt/subosity/
   ├── data/           # Persistent application data
   ├── backups/        # Automated backup storage
   ├── logs/           # Application and installer logs
   ├── configs/        # Generated configuration files
   └── docker/         # Docker Compose and related files
   ```

5. **Supabase Platform Setup**
   - Download and verify Supabase CLI
   - Initialize Supabase project with security defaults
   - Generate strong random passwords for all services
   - Apply database schema and seed data
   - Configure authentication providers
   - Set up edge functions runtime

6. **Application Deployment**
   - Clone `subosity-app` repository (specific release tag)
   - Build production Docker image for React frontend
   - Generate environment-specific configuration
   - Create optimized `docker-compose.yml`

7. **Service Integration**
   - Create `subosity.service` systemd unit
   - Configure log rotation with `logrotate`
   - Set up automated backup schedule via cron
   - Enable and start all services

8. **Security Hardening**
   - Generate TLS certificates (self-signed or Let's Encrypt)
   - Configure reverse proxy with security headers
   - Set up firewall rules (if requested)
   - Apply container security policies

9. **Verification & Health Checks**
   - Verify all containers are running
   - Test database connectivity and authentication
   - Validate frontend accessibility
   - Check API endpoints and edge functions
   - Confirm backup mechanism

### 4.2 Installation via Docker Container

**User Command:**
```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v /opt/subosity:/app \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  subosity/installer:latest setup \
    --env prod \
    --domain mysubosity.com \
    --email admin@mysubosity.com
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Container runs as non-root user within container
- Docker socket access required for service management
- Volume mounts ensure persistence across container restarts
- All functionality identical to script-based installation

### 4.3 Incremental Updates

**User Command:**
```bash
# Recommended: Stop services first for safer updates
sudo systemctl stop subosity
docker run --rm -v /opt/subosity:/app subosity/installer:latest update --env prod
sudo systemctl start subosity
```

**Update Flow:**
1. **Pre-update Safety**
   - Create point-in-time database backup
   - Backup current application configuration
   - Verify sufficient disk space for update

2. **Application Updates**
   - Pull latest `subosity-app` release
   - Rebuild frontend Docker image with new code
   - Update Docker Compose configuration if needed

3. **Database Migrations**
   - Run `supabase db push` to apply schema changes
   - Execute data migrations safely with transaction rollback
   - Verify migration success with health checks

4. **Service Updates**
   - Pull updated Docker images
   - Rolling restart of services to minimize downtime
   - Health check validation after each service restart

5. **Rollback on Failure**
   - Automatic rollback if health checks fail
   - Restore database from pre-update backup
   - Revert to previous application version and configuration

### 4.4 Backup and Restore Operations

**Backup Command:**
```bash
docker run --rm -v /opt/subosity:/app subosity/installer:latest backup --retention 30d
```

**Restore Command:**
```bash
docker run --rm -v /opt/subosity:/app subosity/installer:latest restore --backup 2025-06-20T09:00:00Z
```

**Additional Operations:**
```bash
# List available backups
docker run --rm -v /opt/subosity:/app subosity/installer:latest backup --list

# Status check
docker run --rm -v /opt/subosity:/app subosity/installer:latest status

# View logs
docker run --rm -v /opt/subosity:/app subosity/installer:latest logs --tail 100

# Self-update the installer
docker run --rm -v /opt/subosity:/app subosity/installer:latest self-update
```
