- [x] **Basic Installation Flow**: `./subosity-install --domain=app.example.com --email=admin@example.com`
- [x] **Docker Integration**: Automatic Docker/Docker Compose installation
- [x] **Supabase Setup**: Orchestrate `supabase init` and `supabase start`
- [x] **Development SSL**: Self-signed certificates for local development
- [x] **Basic Validation**: System requirements and dependency checking
- [x] **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and basic recovery

### Success Criteria
```bash
# User can run this and get a working Subosity installation
curl -fsSL https://install.subosity.com | bash -s -- \
  --domain=myapp.local \
  --email=admin@example.com

# Result: Working Subosity instance accessible at https://myapp.local
```

### Technical Foundation
