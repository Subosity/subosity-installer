# üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly. We are committed to working with security researchers to verify and address any potential vulnerabilities that are reported to us.

This project intends to follow the disclosure guidelines from [security.txt](https://securitytxt.org/).

### How to Report
1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.
2. Email us directly at: security@subosity.com
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability.
4. Provide steps to reproduce if possible.
5. Allow reasonable time for response and fix.

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any proposed solutions or mitigations
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Our Security Response Process
- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
- **Assessment**: We will provide an assessment within 1 week.
- **Fix Development**: The timeline for a fix varies based on complexity.
- **Public Disclosure**: We will coordinate public disclosure with you after a fix is released and users have had time to update.

### Responsible Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report.
- We will provide regular updates on our progress.
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer anonymity).
- We will notify you when the vulnerability is fixed.
- We will coordinate public disclosure timing with you.

We do not offer a bug bounty program or any monetary compensation for vulnerability reports. However, we are happy to provide public credit and acknowledgement to researchers who submit valid reports.

## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### Production Deployment Security

```bash
# ‚úÖ Use strong, unique passwords
./subosity-installer setup --env prod --domain example.com \
  --db-password "$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  --jwt-secret "$(openssl rand -base64 64)"

# ‚úÖ Enable firewall protection
./subosity-installer setup --enable-firewall --allowed-ips "10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16"

# ‚úÖ Use proper SSL certificates
./subosity-installer setup --ssl-provider letsencrypt --email admin@example.com
```

### Network Security

- **Firewall**: Always use a firewall (UFW, iptables, or cloud security groups)
- **VPN Access**: Consider VPN-only access for administrative interfaces
- **Regular Updates**: Enable automatic security updates
- **Monitoring**: Set up intrusion detection and log monitoring

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: Database and backup encryption is enabled by default
- **Encryption in Transit**: All communications use TLS 1.3
- **Backup Security**: Backups are encrypted and stored securely
- **Key Management**: Use external key management for production

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Host Machine Security
- Keep your SSH keys secure with proper file permissions (`chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
- Use strong passphrases for SSH keys.
- Regularly rotate SSH keys and GPG keys.
- Keep your `.gitconfig` file permissions restrictive.
- Use GPG signing for commits when possible.

### Container Usage
- Only use trusted base images from official sources.
- Keep base images updated to latest versions.
- Review any additional features you add to the configuration.
- Don't store sensitive data in the container filesystem.
- Use the provided configuration without modifications to critical sections.

### Network Security
- Be cautious when using development containers on shared networks.
- Consider using VPN for remote development.
- Verify SSL certificates when cloning repositories.
- Use SSH over HTTPS when possible for Git operations.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

- **Secure Defaults**: All services configured with security-first defaults
- **Automatic Updates**: Critical security patches applied automatically
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all administrative actions
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions and role separation
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling and timeout policies

### Docker Security

- **Non-Root Containers**: All services run as non-root users
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **Network Isolation**: Containers communicate over isolated networks
- **Image Verification**: All images verified with cryptographic signatures

### Database Security

- **Connection Encryption**: All database connections use TLS
- **Access Controls**: Row-level security and policy enforcement
- **Backup Encryption**: Automated encrypted backups
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit log of all database operations

## üîç Security Scanning

### Automated Security Scanning

We use multiple security scanning tools:

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing on every commit
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing on releases
- **Container Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning of all container images
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning of all dependencies

### Third-Party Security Audits

- **Annual Penetration Testing**: Professional security assessment
- **Code Reviews**: Independent security code reviews
- **Compliance Audits**: SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 assessments

## Known Security Limitations

### Container Isolation
- SSH keys are accessible within the container.
- Git configuration is readable by processes in the container.
- Standard container isolation applies (not VM-level isolation).

### Host Dependencies
- Security depends on host machine SSH key management.
- Host `.gitconfig` security affects container security.
- Docker daemon security affects overall system security.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use dedicated development SSH keys when possible.
- Consider using SSH agent forwarding as an alternative.
- Regularly audit mounted files and permissions.
- Keep development containers separate from production workloads.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as soon as possible after discovery.
- Announced in release notes with severity level.
- Communicated through GitHub security advisories.
- Documented in the changelog with security implications.

## Compliance

This project aims to follow security best practices including:
- Principle of least privilege
- Defense in depth
- Secure by default configuration
- Regular security reviews
- Transparent security practices
